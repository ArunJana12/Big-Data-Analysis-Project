Here's the situation: I and one of my coworkers have been working on a prototype for a startup that could easily be described as a conflict of interest. The startup is in the same industry as the company we work for. The idea involves referring business to companies like the one we work for. In one sense, we'd be driving business to the one we work for, but would also be driving business to direct competitors (hence the conflict of interest).<p>At some point, we will have to have a conversation with our boss. I'm trying to come up with a way to spin the conversation so that it could be a mutually beneficial arrangement. Ideally, it would be great if the company would seed fund us, although that is a very long shot. <p>As I stated above, in one sense it could be beneficial because our startup would be driving business to the company, but on the other hand, it would also be driving business to its competitors. <p>We aren't comfortable with flying under the radar as long as we can - so we either need to get out now or work on a prototype and when it's further along, have a sit-down with our boss. <p>Has anyone been in this situation?

Customers pay up front for however many days they want. They can purchase additional days whenever they want. There is no automatic recurring billing -- the web app is simply 'paused' when it runs out of days.<p>What is the best way to go about handling credit/debit card processing and invoicing for this?<p>I'm playing around with using Paypal Website Payments Standard with encrypted 'buy it now' buttons and Instant Payment Notification (IPN).
However, the user-experience for credit-card payments with PayPal is lacking. Specifically, Paypal does not auto-redirect users back to my website if they use a credit card (auto-redirect works only with PayPal payments).

We'd love to play all day but that just isn't practical. So we came up with a good solution. When it's time to play dolls or paint or whatever it is we're not sure we have time to do, we give her the option of how many minutes she wants to play. Offer up 15 minutes, sometimes she wants less, sometimes more. Then set the timer and give her our total uninterrupted attention.

We provide termite adoption services for lumberyards.<p>While termite adoption may sound terrible at first blush, we believe it to be adviseable.  The termites can dispose of wracked beams without requiring burning.  The termites can also eliminate small pieces of discarded wood, and partly take care of cleaning the sawing site in your stead.  They can also easily consume stockpiles that are no longer useful.  This may be especially valuable in sight of the housing downturn in your area and subsequent inventory surpluses you may be dealing with.  Any surplus inventory you give to the termites will largely be metabolized by the termites, and therefore decrease in volume.  From a practical  point of view, a termite nest can perform in your lumber yard the task it performs in nature; that of a recycler.  At this point you can exploint the large amount of fertilizer left over and sell it.<p>You are in a position at which you can begin to sell natural fertilizer easily.  Consumers relate your core business to fixing homes.  You provide beams for home improvement purposes, and while that segment of the housing market is falling, the gardening market is holding up because desperate sellers will try to improve the curb appeal of their house in order to finally sell their house.  This means home sellers are improving their gardens, which involves the use of fertilizer.  As the housing downturn has affected your core business for the worse, why not hedge these losses by entering the fertilizer market?<p>Not only will termites reduce costs and expand your business, they will also provide excellent public relations.  Ecology is in these days; Whole Foods can charge about twice the usual price for its products solely because they are organic.  This despite any evidence the food the sell is actually better in any way.  Many consumers may want to reduce their carbon footprint.  By buying your fertilizer, they effectively stop about half of the carbon in a plank from reaching the atmosphere.  This will provide cheap and novel marketing for both your core business and your fertilizer business.<p>We'll be the first to acknowledge that termites pose a serious risk to wood.  They can devastate a home if left unattended for a few years.  A simple ""moat"" around the termite's designated space will be able to effectively stop the termites from harming the good wood.  In doing so, you will showcase your expertise in handling lumber and the confidence you have in your abilities.  You may be able to sell termite control sprays in the process.<p>At Intermite, we believe adopting a nest will be an excellent way to help your core lumber business.  For an up-front set-up fee of $449.00, we offer the delivery and installation and setup of a termite nest in your lumberyard.<p>A nest costs $450.00 plus tax.  This fee includes includes delivery and installation.  We offer related products such as custom fertilizer bags,<p>Regards,
Intermite",,,1.0,daniel-cussen

He mentioned that it took them a couple of days to add it in and test it out and fix all the issues.<p>And you know how many people signed up using OpenID? 10. Not percent, just ten people signed up using OpenID in the past 40 days. These guys have about 900+ new subscribers per day.<p>Anyway, if you have a limited amount of time and money to spend on an app, spend your energy somewhere else until OpenID becomes (if ever) more adopted.",,,10.0,nickb

Specifically about international and cross-currency payments.<p>If I'm a seller with a US-based PayPal account and I want everything in USD on my end, the base rate is 2.9% + $0.30 USD. If the payment is coming from outside the US, the fee is 3.9% + $0.30 USD.<p>And it looks like there's an extra 2.5% put on top when there's currency conversion involved. But when is that 2.5% added? Another related thing I don't get: PPCalc says that ""fees are calculated in the sender's currency"", see <a href=""http://www.ppcalc.com/faq.html#faqlink05"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ppcalc.com/faq.html#faqlink05</a><p>Do I have to know what country the user's in and what currency he pays with to determine the fee? In other words, will I only know the exact fee afterwards when PayPal tells me what it is? Problem with that is ... we want to show our users something like ""To top up your account by $100.00, you'll be paying a total of $103.30 including PayPal fees. Go ahead?""<p>Anyone know how this all works, or know a nice, simple page which explains it?<p>(Yes, I know about PayPal Sandbox, but the sandbox user profiles have limited options, and I'm not sure I'm getting all the country/currency options.)

They won't all invest, but each time you pitch, you get better. Each time you pitch, you get asked different questions, get different opinions and ideas. It's worth it to pitch as many people as you can, as often as you can. Wil Schroter says it perfectly, pitch everyone, all the time.<p>Some questions will get asked over and over. And you'll discover those patterns quickly enough and adjust your pitch accordingly. If you have a less-than-stellar answer to a question that gets asked once or twice, it's not a big deal. But if your weaker answers are to the most common investor questions, you've got a problem.<p>With that in mind, here are some of the more common questions investors will ask:<p><pre><code>   1. So what's your business all about? The wording of this question will change, but this is the classic ""elevator pitch"" question. Translation: ""In the shortest amount of time possible, grab my interest by the proverbial you-know-whats."" Sell them quick, with something simple and powerful they can remember; and keep reiterating that message throughout your presentation.
   2. What's the barrier to entry for competition? For Web 2.0 startups this can be tough. The question comes from VCs and angels that might not be as familiar with the overall industry and the ease with which many web applications can be built. They're looking for a real technological barrier that might not exist. Some answers that might help you skirt this topic: launching big, building a devoted community, key partnerships and/or customers (before launch), we're cooler than everyone else (this won't work.) None of these answers are great (for a host of reasons.)
   3. What's going to stop big monster company in your space from copying you? This is almost identical to Question #2 but it's more commonly asked because there's always competition. And, it's usually from the ""big bad wolf"" company that's got tons of money, lots of market share, a huge staff and years of experience.

      For starters, don't say, ""What competition? We don't have any"". There's always competition.

      Secondly, this is a tough question to answer. What is stopping ""big bad wolf"" company from copying you instantly and smashing you like a bug? Generally, you can argue:
          * We can move more quickly.
          * Big bad wolf is too busy managing what it's doing to innovate.
          * They'll acquire us rather than copy us (if you have examples, use them.)
   4. Why are you raising the money you want to raise? The amount you're asking for is critical. Make sure you've done your financial homework. Don't tell them your numbers are conservative, just explain to them how you arrived at them.
   5. How far does that money get you? Have a good answer to this question. Couch this in product and financial terms, i.e. ""It gets us 6 months past launch, when we expect to be cash flow positive."" The best way to think about this is to calculate how long the money will last if you earn zero revenue. Count backwards by 4-6 months and that will tell you when you need to start the process of raising more money. If the money is only going to last you 4-6 months, you need to start looking for more money almost immediately (which isn't a pleasant thought.)
   6. Do you have any customers? Have you spoken to potential customers? Investors are looking for traction, or at least the inkling of traction. As soon as possible, try and get a few potential customers to say, ""Sounds interesting."" You might even use them as references. This raises the comfort level for investors and helps answer the question, ""What's the market?""
   7. What's your marketing strategy? For early stage companies this is a very tough question. Chances are ""just getting to freaking launch"" is what you're thinking, but that's not good enough. And ""launch big"" is equally uninspiring. Think about presenting a timeline of events and customer acquisition numbers that you're anticipating, tied to marketing. Throw in a variety of strategies that you're going to do or researching. Marketing will be critical to your success, so you better plan for it sooner rather than later.
   8. What are you coding in? Investors do want technical details. This is an easy question to answer at least (assuming you know!)
   9. How are you handling the technological infrastructure for scaling? Like I said, investors want technical details. They want to know that you've thought about the behind-the-scenes technology to support your system. When you get on the front page of TechCrunch, will the server hold up? When customers are signing up faster than you can process their credit cards (don't let that happen!), will the system stay running at a reasonable speed? The further you get along in the process with investors, the more technical details they'll want.
  10. What's the team look like? What are your backgrounds? Investors want to know the backgrounds of the founders. If you've got people on staff, they'll want to know who, why you hired those people, and who else (and how many) you need to bring on board. They'll want to know how quickly you expect to grow the team over time as well.

Although there are common questions you'll get from venture capitalists and angel investors, what's more fascinating is that each investor will ask different questions. You can't be prepared for every question, but even if you get new ones, the more comfortable you are pitching (because you've done it so many times), the better.",,,0.0,anjamerret

Today you didn't jump out of bed because you were sleeping at your desk.  You responded (3 hours later) to a text message your wife sent you asking if you were going to make it home tonight.  You're not worrying about conquering the world today anymore, you're worried about how you're going to pay your mortgage tomorrow. <p>What the hell happened?<p>The Road is Longer than it Appears<p>The first mistake you made was convincing yourself and those around you that it would only be tough for a year.  Startups take a long time to become successful, and even though you may read about one that grew quickly, most do not. <p><pre><code>    You need to recalibrate.  Set your horizons for a 3-year window, not a 12 month window.  
</code></pre>
Realize that it may be longer than that.  It's a startup career, not a startup project.<p>Spend Less Now<p>If you were like most, you tried to maintain your lifestyle while you eased into your startup world. That doesn't happen.  That's like trying to go camping and bitching about not having Air Conditioning in your tent.  You're in the wild, you need to rough it.<p>To do that, you need to cut every last expense you have, and then cut some more. <p><pre><code>    If you haven't figured it out by now, I can tell you first hand that things are going to get worse (financially) before they get better.

When you started this company it was about more than just a big check (right?). <p><pre><code>    You started this company because you were passionate about blazing your own trail.  You're doing it right now, and it's hard.  But don't forget why you made this decision.

I've read most of them already, but I'm sure many of them will make more sense now.<p>In parallel to such reading, I'll finish a pet project with no business aspirations, which I want for personal use: a subset/bastardization of the editor part of Jef Raskin's Humane Environment (AKA Archy).  I plan to use that as my programming editor from then on.  I did a couple prototypes in the past and I know I like it.  I don't like Archy itself because of its compromise of using alt keys for leaping; I got myself a thinkpad-like keyboard with buttons under the space bar for this purpose.  Again, this is something I had put on hold for too long, and I want to give it a chance before I commit full force to a startup.  <p>I'll timebox 4 months for this although, in good programmer optimism tradition, I hope I'll be done earlier. After that, done or not, I plan to put out a few cheap startup failures fast.  This is much in the spirit of the common advice to novice Go players: ""lose your first fifty games fast"".  I'll just brainstorm for projects that I can execute by myself in, say, one month.  At the end of the timeboxed period, if the project is not anywhere near shippable state, I shelve it and move to something else.  Otherwise, I throw it at people and see what happens.  Then follow up on the ones that get a better reaction.<p>From this I expect to get some basic competence in business (esp. marketing and dealing with users), system administration, and fluency in web programming (my background is in user interface design and programming for a MMOG).  I also expect to get something I can show to potential cofounders so they can evaluate my taste and my ability to execute.  And who knows, maybe something more ambitious grows out of one of these ideas.<p>My goal is to be able to apply to YC with a straight face in winter 2008 or summer 2009.<p>Please let me know what do you think about this.  Don't pull any punches; I'm interested in criticism, objections, and alternatives, rather than moral support.<p>Thanks for reading this far!",,,49.0,euccastro

I hope you survive as an Independent Consultant... I really do.  Yet before you jump ship for the bountiful glory that is independent consulting, allow me to tell you the story of Zed - a person much like you that failed to realize the true evil that lurks behind the facade of independent consulting.<p>Meet our Hero: Zed<p>Meet our hero, Zed.  Long ago, Zed was working as a star programmer for a consulting company getting paid $30 per hour while billing out $150 per hour to their client (probably more).  Zed used his superior analytical skills to learn that his company is being paid $120 per hour more than Zed is being paid.  Thats just ludicrous!<p>So Zed did what any entrepreneurial minded superhero would do - he quit his job and went to work for the client as an Independent Consultant. This move now got him paid $60 per hour.  The client paid out less, Zed's made twice as much, and that evil consulting company had been banished into oblivion.  <p><pre><code>    Everything is now right in the world.  Zed is now living the life as an Independent Consultant - the dream job that's easy to start and nearly impossible to sustain.
</code></pre>
But Zed's bliss would not last forever.  Little did Zed know, that a new menace was about to rear it's ugly head - An evil force known as ""Nu Bidnsss."" <p>Our Villain: Nu Bidnsss<p>Within his first year of consulting, Zed was protected (financially) from ever having to deal with Nu Bidnsss.  He was heavily sheltered in the warmth of a paying client to whom he could enjoy a prosperous life. <p>Yet like every consulting engagement, the client too eventually fell out of love with Zed.  Zed's incredible programming abilities eventually gave the client a product they were proud of, and soon Zed would not be needed any longer.<p>One day, as Zed left a client ""wrap up"" meeting, he felt a cold chill across the back of his neck.  He tensed, turned around quickly and saw the most fearsome creature he had ever laid eyes upon - Nu Bidnsss.<p>Nu Bidnsss Sucks<p>Without a lofty paying contract firmly in his hands, Zed did not know how to attack Nu Bidnsss.   Beating this evil beast required abilities he had never learned, like salesmanship, networking, and the Shaolin art of the ""Ass Kiss."" <p>Zed realized at that moment, that his training was all wrong.  Until now he had made a great living by being a star programmer.  His skills had made him heavily recruited out of college, highly sought-after in his consulting company, and well-paid from clients.  Certainly with these skills he would never have to come face-to-face with Nu Bidnsss.  Yet here he was, staring it down.<p>The Fall of Zed<p>Try as he might, Zed could not stop the force of Nu Bidnsss.  It quickly swallowed up his savings, his second mortgage, and all of his credit cards.  As Zed struggled wildly to defeat the beast, he realized that it was not his ability to work for clients that would save his life, it was his ability to get new clients, that would be his lifeblood.<p><pre><code>    Alas, Zed has no frigging clue how to get new clients. 
</code></pre>
And so Zed was defeated by Nu Bidnsss.  Drained of any of his financial resources, emotional excitement and his seemingly endless list of smart-ass remarks, he was taken by Nu Bidnsss and forced to work in the salt mine cubicles of hell - Big Corporate.<p>- The End -<p>Epilogue<p>This story is as sad as it is consistently true. <p>Surviving as an independent consultant isn't about actually consulting (it's a given that you can do that.)  It's about finding new business.<p>As it happens, most people suck at finding new business.  Once the Pixie Dust of the first client engagement wears off, the painful reality of having to beg for business becomes very obvious.<p>If you truly want to build a business as a consultant, focus on the business of selling yourself, not specifically on delivery.  If you're not good enough to get yourself in the door on your own merits, your life as an Independent Consultant is going to be short-lived at best.  Like our boy Zed.",,,12.0,joshua8883

When Carleen asked me what I was up to, I explained that I was buried in back-to-back meetings with folks around town discussing my current project, Go BIG Network. ""Are you fund-raising?"" she asked, to which I responded: ""No, I'm friend-raising!"" I wasn't kidding. I was on a mission to make as many new friends as possible.<p>You see, our company's growth isn't only dependent on finding more cash; but it is dependent on us meeting more people. And frankly, I've always found ""raising friends"" is far more valuable than raising money.<p>The Monetary Value of a Friend
For the sake of this argument, let's set aside the fact that true friendships aren't really about money. But in a business context we're probably not talking about true friendships at all. We're talking about building relationships with people who can help grow your business; put another way, people whom you would otherwise have to pay money to meet.<p>For example, you could take some of your VC funding and hire a business development executive to go out and build new partnerships on behalf of your company, and to extend to your operations with his or her existing rolodex of ""friends."" But, you'd be ""purchasing"" those relationships and deals X to the tune of about $100,000 in annual salary for the biz dev executive.<p>Now imagine that this same biz dev exec is a friend of yours. Instead of shelling out six figures in cash, he or she simply would make the same introductions for you as a favor. In this case, the value received is exactly the same, but the cost to you is zero.<p>So while many entrepreneurs spend most of their time ingratiating themselves with VCs in order to collaterally gain access to useful people, I figure out who those useful people are first, and then spend all my time trying to meet them myself.<p>This is what I mean when I say I swap fund-raising for friend-raising.<p>Wait a Minute! Isn't that just ""Networking?""
Okay, sure it is. It's networking. It's business development. Sometimes it means pretending that the people I meet at a cocktail party aren't as important to my business as they are, and so forth. It's all of those things, but more importantly, it's recognizing that money typically buys relationships in an indirect way. It's also recognizing that the more relationships I build, the less money I need.<p>My Friendship-Development Plan
You've heard of a ""Business Development Plan"". It's a series of targets and milestones that execs use to grow their sales efforts. I've worked on BD Plans for ten different companies, and in every case, it was ultimately about creating relationships.<p>When I realized this, I shifted my focus to the Friendship Development Plan. I laid out all of the relationships that I would need to have X everyone from investors and advisors to bloggers and customers. Then I created milestones or targets, focused on a few people whom I would try to build a relationship with along a specific timeline.<p>I divided the list of friend prospects into strategic categories. For example, I knew Go BIG would need a voice in the blogging community, so I set out to build relationships with the folks at GigaOM (parent of Found|Read), VentureBeat, and TechCrunch. I've now written for all four of these sites!<p>By simply picking up the phone and forging relationships with Om, Matt and Mike directly, I avoided needing to pay some PR agency a $10,000-a-month retainer for the same benefit.<p>Getting Serious About Friend-Raising
Most founders know that they need to network more, but they still don't do it. Yet inexplicably, entrepreneurs happily devote countless hours to courting the gods of venture capital.<p>If you could take all the time and energy you've spent courting capital and express it in terms of ""useful resources purchased,"" I think you'd find that getting serious about ""friend-raising"" is the more economical proposition.<p>Your plan to build friends won't ever be as quantitative as a tradtional sales planXin which it is possible to tie new customer relationships directly to receivables. Don't be so callous as to try to equate every new friend to a dollar figure (which is just weird). Quantify it this way: as the total value of time and energy you save in terms of the fund-raising you no longer need to do_.<p>In Go BIG's case, by taking all the time and energy that might have gone into fund-raising and refocusing it on building relationships ourselves with the media, customers, partners, and talent, we avoided taking a first round of capital. I can't say how much any one of these friend-relationships is worth in simple dollars, but I do know that we skipped raising what otherwise would have been a $2 million A-Round. And Go BIG did just fine.<p>Of course, now that I've said all this, I'm probably get a bill from Carleen. But it still will have been worth it.",,,1.0,joshua8883

But sometimes having a smaller piece of a bigger pie is not a better meal.<p>
Diluting your stake in your company in order to grow can backfire dramatically if you donaEURXt consider all of the variables.<p>
The Control Issue<p>
Before we even get into the economics of the deal, letaEURXs first talk about what really matters aEUR"" the ability to control your own destiny.<p>
When you owned the majority share of your company, you may not have had the brightest future, but it was your future to determine. Now youaEURXre talking about putting your future in someone elseaEURXs hands indefinitely. Selling your company is like joining the mob aEUR"" once youaEURXre in, youaEURXre not getting back out.<p>
Having a smaller piece of the bigger pie depends on the assumption that whoever youaEURXre giving control to will be more successful at creating a profitable outcome for the company. ItaEURXs not just the acquiring CEO, either. ItaEURXs every person in the new organization, from the finance department to the marketing team.<p>
Essentially, youaEURXre entrusting an entire organization to collectively make better decisions for your own business than you as an individual can. Are you ready to make that commitment?<p>
The Exponential Outcome Issue<p>
Now on to the economics. Surely youaEURXve figured out that owning 10% of a $15 million company is worth more than 100% of a $1 million company. What weaEURXre really talking about is the probability of a bigger outcome later on, not the dollar value today.<p>
Obviously the smaller your stake in the company, the bigger the outcome needs to be in order to break even. This is especially important when taking on a round of investment. Every time you give equity away to investors, you will need a substantially larger sale in order to receive the same return.<p>
To this point someone will invariably talk about how having a 20% stake in YouTube, selling at $1.6 billion, was not a bad deal, and it wasnaEURXt. But how many companies experience the same kind of success that YouTube did? Very few.<p>
ItaEURXs far more likely that youaEURXll sell your company for $10 million with 100% ownership than that you will sell your company for $100 million with 10% ownership. ThataEURXs because the bigger the pie, the fewer the people that can eat it.<p>
The Faster Growth Issue<p>
The other side of the economic issue is the question of when to take your slice of the pie. LetaEURXs assume your company is worth $10 million, which is exactly what you are doing in sales this year. You merge into a company worth $100 million and take a 10% stake in that company. In order for your 10% to double in value, the new company needs to grow to $200 million in sales.<p>
Yet in order for your company to double in size at its present value of $10 million, you only need to do $20 million in sales. The question then becomes aEUR"" is it more likely that youaEURXll be able to add $10 million in sales or that the new company will add $100 million in sales?<p>
The difference in infrastructure, business development, and capital requirements of creating $10 million worth of growth versus $100 million worth of growth is enormous. Or said differently, it takes exponentially more effort to double the size of a big company than a small one.<p>
Taking that smaller slice could actually substantially inhibit your value if you take it too early. If youaEURXre already growing so quickly, and your future is so bright, would it be worth it to hold out longer to get a bigger slice of the bigger pie?<p>
The Pie ThataEURXs aEURoeJust RightaEURX<p>
So if all of these questions make you want to bail on the idea of taking a smaller stake, what would possibly make you think itaEURXs the right idea?<p>
A lot of it comes down to timing. If youaEURXre at a point where you just canaEURXt handle the daily grind of managing a company, turning it over to someone else may be worthwhile, despite lost value. Or if you truly believe that youaEURXve tapped out the hyper growth opportunities then it would make sense to latch on to a faster moving train.<p>
In a nutshell, the timing is just right when the big questions weaEURXre asking here donaEURXt seem so important. If you think that the management in this new company is just right, the likelihood of a sale is around the corner, and your individual gains could never outpace what this new venture could yield, by all means go for it.<p>",,,2.0,joshua8883

On TV there is not one channel for every show; there are many channels that focus on certain types of shows.  The internet should be the same.  There should be many websites that focus on specific types of shows, and there should be one directory that lists all these websites.  <p>This is just a fringe thought, but imagine if a company builds an application that lets all the major media companies have their own website, where they can show whatever shows they want. And all this application does is tie all the video websites together.  <p>Kind of like how Yahoo listed all the cool websites, this application could list all the cool video websites [in an interactive way].

It's a Rails app using MySQL (though database choice doesn't matter, since it's Rails).  I'm considering launching the app purely on S3 + EC2.  The idea is, the code will live in S3 by using the S3 filesystem component.  I can develop locally and deploy via Capistrano when I push out a new release.  The code is then deployed to S3 and the EC2 instance restarts.<p>I'm wondering if this is even viable.  Has anyone else that you know of done it? <p>For the database, I have two options.  I could either leave the database on the EC2 instance and back it up nightly and never restart the instance (since data only disappears if you restart the instance or due to a hardware failure).  The advantage there is database queries are most likely much faster, since it doesn't have to hit the network for each new database query.  The disadvantage is, the data may disappear at the drop of a hat, and then it's backup-restore time.  The other option is keeping the database in S3, which seems totally secure but might be slow for queries.  I'll, of course, be using memcached and other caching mechanisms, but database load seems like it could still play a part.<p>What d'you think, would you launch on EC2 + S3?<p>",,,27.0,palish
